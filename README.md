Installation

All libraries available on Anaconda distribution of python.

Reason for the project:
In this project I use the BMW Car Pricing challenge dataset that I found on Kaggle to help get a better idea on what influences price by looking at:

Which of the features negatively affects the price?
What are the top 5 factors that strongly contribute to the price in the positive direction?
Is the data linear enought to go with the Linear Regression model, or are there better models we can find?
How big on the price is the influence of the factors not represented in the data?
This project forms form part of 1 or 4 projects in my studies with Udacity under the Data Science Nanodegree program.


File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.
Notes are given as you go through the code.
I have also included the dataset from Kaggle.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available in Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bmw-pricing-challenge-nkosinathi-magagula

Acknowledgements
The dataset was issued from Kaggle on the BMW Pricing Challenge.
